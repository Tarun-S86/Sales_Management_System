# Sales_Management_System
As a part of my 6th semester mini project on File Structures, Sales Management System packs file structures concepts like - indexing, hashing, delimiting etc. This project's main aim is to make keeping track of sales easier. 
This project is developed using Python, python tkinter module for gui.

To run this project:
Change file directory in all .py files to your file location.
Open login.py and run it (I would suggest using vscode)

User id and Password is Admin 12345, you can change it in admin.txt (I would suggest you to create a new user and use your own password because the password will be encrypted and only you can remember it).
